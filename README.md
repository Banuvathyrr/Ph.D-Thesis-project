<h1 align="center">Studies on the applicability of the mechanical advantage hypothesis of grasping</h1>
During my Ph.D. in Neuromechanics, I conducted groundbreaking research focused on understanding the intricate relationship between neural control and mechanical behavior in human fingertips. Leveraging advanced techniques in data collection, analysis, and visualization, my study involved gathering fingertip force data from human participants to unravel underlying neuromuscular mechanisms. Employing sophisticated statistical analyses, I examined patterns within the collected data to discern key insights into motor control processes and sensorimotor integration. Utilizing data visualization tools, I effectively communicated complex findings, enabling compelling data storytelling and facilitating broader understanding within the scientific community. This interdisciplinary endeavor underscores my proficiency in integrating principles from biomechanics, neuroscience, and data science to unravel fundamental questions in human motor control.

### Introduction

- For a long time, we have wondered about the strategy used by our brain to attain object stabilization while grasping an object that undergoes a change in size, shape, mass and surface property.
- The strategy used by the brain can be quantitatively assessed by measuring the fingertip forces generated while holding the object.
- Grasping force or the normal forces exerted by the individual fingers while performing a grasping task should be in such a way that it is neither too large to crush or damage the object nor too small to drop the object.
- Fine adjustment of the normal and tangential forces is essential for the successful completion of the task.
- Grip force is the normal force acting perpendicular to the surface of the object while load force is a tangential force acting parallel to the surface of the object to balance the weight of the object.

### Motivation for the current research

- Motivation for the current study is that there are certain objects in real life like hand held pocket radio, Retractable ball point pens and pipette controllers that consists of slider on the thumb side for the fine adjustment of its functionality.
- The current research was inspired by observing such objects.
- This triggered to question on how object stabilization would be attained while holding a handle when the thumb is placed on a slider or an unsteady base.

### Research Question
How object stabilization is achieved while holding a handle that consists of unsteady thumb base?

### Experimental apparatus
- A handle with slider platform was designed. 
- By this way, The friction between the platform and handle frame is reduced. This will in turn casue torque changes to the handle.
- Total mass of the handle including the slider platform is 535gms.
- On the thumb side of the handle frame, a vertical railing was fitted to mount the slider platform. A mechanical constraint was used to fix the position of the slider at the HOME position (that s found midway between middle and ring fingers).
- In the absence of mechanical constraint, slider could translate in the vertical direction over the railing like this.  Five 6 axis force/torque sensors were mounted to measure the fingertip forces of individual fingers and thumb.
- Force sensor for thumb was placed on the slider platform. A laser displ sensor was placed on top of the handle toward the thumb side  to measure the position of the slider platform. An acrylic block was attached on top in the anterior posterior direction to mount electromagnetic tracking sensor and bull’s eye.
- Bull’s eye provide tilt feedback to the participant.
