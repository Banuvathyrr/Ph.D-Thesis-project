<h1 align="center">Studies on the applicability of the mechanical advantage hypothesis of grasping</h1>
During my Ph.D. in Neuromechanics, I conducted groundbreaking research focused on understanding the intricate relationship between neural control and mechanical behavior in human fingertips. Leveraging advanced techniques in data collection, analysis, and visualization, my study involved gathering fingertip force data from human participants to unravel underlying neuromuscular mechanisms. Employing sophisticated statistical analyses, I examined patterns within the collected data to discern key insights into motor control processes and sensorimotor integration. Utilizing data visualization tools, I effectively communicated complex findings, enabling compelling data storytelling and facilitating broader understanding within the scientific community. This interdisciplinary endeavor underscores my proficiency in integrating principles from biomechanics, neuroscience, and data science to unravel fundamental questions in human motor control.

### Introduction

- For a long time, we have wondered about the strategy used by our brain to attain object stabilization while grasping an object that undergoes a change in size, shape, mass and surface property.
- The strategy used by the brain can be quantitatively assessed by measuring the fingertip forces generated while holding the object.
- Grasping force or the normal forces exerted by the individual fingers while performing a grasping task should be in such a way that it is neither too large to crush or damage the object nor too small to drop the object.
- Fine adjustment of the normal and tangential forces is essential for the successful completion of the task.
- Grip force is the normal force acting perpendicular to the surface of the object while load force is a tangential force acting parallel to the surface of the object to balance the weight of the object.

### Motivation for the current research

- Motivation for the current study is that there are certain objects in real life like hand held pocket radio, Retractable ball point pens and pipette controllers that consists of slider on the thumb side for the fine adjustment of its functionality.
- The current research was inspired by observing such objects.
- This triggered to question on how object stabilization would be attained while holding a handle when the thumb is placed on a slider or an unsteady base.

### Research Question
How object stabilization is achieved while holding a handle that consists of unsteady thumb base?

### Experimental apparatus
- A handle with slider platform was designed. 
- By this way, The friction between the platform and handle frame is reduced. This will in turn casue torque changes to the handle.
- Total mass of the handle including the slider platform is 535gms.
- On the thumb side of the handle frame, a vertical railing was fitted to mount the slider platform. A mechanical constraint was used to fix the position of the slider at the HOME position (that s found midway between middle and ring fingers).
- In the absence of mechanical constraint, slider could translate in the vertical direction over the railing like this.  Five 6 axis force/torque sensors were mounted to measure the fingertip forces of individual fingers and thumb.
- Force sensor for thumb was placed on the slider platform. A laser displ sensor was placed on top of the handle toward the thumb side  to measure the position of the slider platform. An acrylic block was attached on top in the anterior posterior direction to mount electromagnetic tracking sensor and bull’s eye.
- Bull’s eye provide tilt feedback to the participant.

</p>

### Data Collection

- Four experiments were conducted using the experimental apparatus.
- Around 100 participants volunteered to participate in the experiments.
- Each experiment had different task to be performed with the same experimental apparatus.
- The experiment involved set of trials. Each trial lasted for few seconds.
- Fingertip force data and position data was collected while performing each trial.

### Experiment description
- A pattern tracing study was conducted to examine the contributions of peripheral fingers when the thumb platform was translated in the vertical direction while grasping the handle.

- Based on a multi-finger study, when the thumb was held at the level above and below the center of the middle and ring finger sensor, the change in the percentage of peripheral finger grip forces was comparable

</p>

- Therefore, it was expected that the change in grip force of peripheral fingers would be same when the thumb was shifted to the level above and below the middle and ring finger sensor center.
- On the contrary, the change was significantly greater for the little finger than the index finger.
- The little finger showed a drop in the tangential force, while the remaining fingers showed a rise in the tangential force when the thumb platform moved upward.
- Similarly, when the thumb platform was moving downward, the little finger showed a rise in the load force while the remaining fingers showed a drop in the tangential force.

</p>


- The result shows that the little finger behaves completely different from the other fingers during the thumb translation.
- Thus, fingertip force data of the individual fingers conveys a biomechanical relationship between the thumb and little finger.

- Although the little finger has a smaller structure than other fingers, the biomechanical and neural inter-relationship between the little finger and thumb served to act as a source for such a marked behavior of the little finger compared to the index finger.

*Synergy analysis*
- Finger force covariation was quantified to examine the existence of synergy. 
- Synergy is defined as a set of elemental variables with a purpose of stabilizing a certain performance variable

*Linear discriminant analysis*
- To examine how the change in tangential force produced by the thumb affected the moments produced by normal forces and hence, the static equilibrium of the object, we used a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
- A linear discriminant classifier was trained with the set of data points on thumb tangential force and the moments mentioned above for the two conditions: Fixed (platform fixed) and Free (platform movable).
- The two different conditions: fixed and free were considered to be the two different classes for the purpose of LDA. 
- Both the classes were found to be linearly separable by a decision boundary that was constructed using LDA. 
- The classifier was trained with 405 data points on thumb tangential force and moment due to normal forces of the individual fingers.
- LDA was able to predict the test data at an accuracy of 98%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity and precision of 97%, false-positive rate of 2% for all four cases.

*Correlation analysis*
- To find the relationship between the individual fingertip normal forces, correlation analysis was performed.

### Statistical analysis
- For the current research, repeated measures design has been adopted in designing all four experiments.    
- According to this design method, multiple measures were taken for the same variable, and same set of participants under different conditions.    
- By having a greater number of trials (repeated measures) with limited number of participants, a better statistical power can be achieved.  
- As a result, if there exists any effect, the statistical test that we employ can detect the effect accurately.  
- For statistical power computation, GPower software was used.

</p>  

- Two way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to investigate the statistical significance between the variables (fingertip forces) using R programming.  
- Two One Sided T-test approach (TOST) was performed to examine the statistical equivalence between the variables.  

```
// To find equivalence bounds for a 15 participants and statistical power of 95%

[1] -0.9307599  0.9307599
```
```

TOST results:
t-value lower bound: 3.04 	p-value lower bound: 0.004
t-value upper bound: -4.16 	p-value upper bound: 0.0005
degrees of freedom : 14

Equivalence bounds (Cohen's dz):
low eqbound: -0.93

upper bound 90% CI:  0.367

NHST confidence interval:
lower bound 95% CI: -0.824
upper bound 95% CI:  0.484

Equivalence Test Result:
The equivalence test was significant, t(14) = 3.044, p = 0.00437, given equivalence bounds of -1.098 and 1.098 (on a raw scale) and an alpha of 0.05.
Null Hypothesis Test Result:
The null hypothesis test was non-significant, t(14) = -0.558, p = 0.586, given an alpha of 0.05.
Based on the equivalence test and the null-hypothesis test combined, we can conclude that the observed effect is statistically not different from zero and statistically equivalent to zero.

### Insights
- The contribution of the ulnar fingers for establishing equilibrium was examined when the thumb was placed on an unsteady platform.
- In general, it was a common question to understand what strategy central nervous system employs in achieving the goal of any grasping task. However, in this particular research, inaddition to the strategy employed , at what situation particular strategy was followed by central nervous system was investigated.
- The distinct behavior of the little finger compared to the other finger forces perhaps suggests a biomechanical relationship between thumb and little finger.
