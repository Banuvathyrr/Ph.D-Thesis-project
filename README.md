# Studies on the applicability of the mechanical advantage hypothesis of grasping
During my Ph.D. in Neuromechanics, I conducted groundbreaking research focused on understanding the intricate relationship between neural control and mechanical behavior in human fingertips. Leveraging advanced techniques in data collection, analysis, and visualization, my study involved gathering fingertip force data from human participants to unravel underlying neuromuscular mechanisms. Employing sophisticated statistical analyses, I examined patterns within the collected data to discern key insights into motor control processes and sensorimotor integration. Utilizing data visualization tools, I effectively communicated complex findings, enabling compelling data storytelling and facilitating broader understanding within the scientific community. This interdisciplinary endeavor underscores my proficiency in integrating principles from biomechanics, neuroscience, and data science to unravel fundamental questions in human motor control.
